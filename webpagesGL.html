    <p>Hello! My name is Rohit Arun and I am currently a <em>freshman</em> at North Carolina
    State University. I am originally from <ins>Chicago, Illinois</ins>, but my family moved to
    Chapel Hill when I was 11 years old. I have recently discovered a passion for Computer
    Science, and am excited to see where this takes me. In my free time, I enjoy playing Basketball,
    doing the Wordle of the day (linked below), and playing Clash Royale. <strong>Thanks for checking in!</strong>
